# StoreFront Project Overview

StoreFront is Angular application that allows users to view a list of available products to purchase, add them to a shopping cart, and ultimately complete the checkout process.

## Getting Started
1. **Install Node.js and npm:**
If developers haven't installed Node.js and npm, it is a prerequisite.

2. **Install Angular CLI globally:**
If developers haven't installed Angular CLI globally, they need to run the following command:

```bash
npm install -g @angular/cli
```

This step should be done before developers clone the project.

3. **Install Dependencies:**
Developers should install the project dependencies by running:

```bash
npm install
```

4. **Start the Development Server:**
Developers can start the development server with the following command:

```bash
ng serve
```

This allows developers to run the Angular application locally. Running npm install is only necessary if dependencies have changed, typically only needed on the first run.


## Project Instructions

#### Project features

This application reflects the same user experience as that of a real-world e-commerce website, including a(n):

* **Product list** page, which displays the available products for the user to choose and add to their cart (in various quantities)
* **Product details** page, which displays more information about any particular product
* **Shopping cart**, which includes the products that the user has added to their cart
* **Checkout form**, which collects information about the user (e.g., name, address, payment details, etc.)
* **Order confirmation page**, which shows the outcome after the user completes the checkout process (i.e., submits the checkout form)
